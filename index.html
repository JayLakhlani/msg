                Hey shaillu, i just wanted to tell you about something. Ok, i will stop beating around the bush.
                Its just that i have been crushing on you for a long time now, it just because of the exams and 
                everything that i didnt want to tell you about it. Now, that i have guts to tell you about it, 
                i just wanted to say that I like you shaillu and would love to date you. Call me superstitious, but
                the mind telepthy is something that i consider as a sign for it. Im not sure what you are feeling 
                right now. But dont be mad at me lol. I thought of flexing my tamil, but my vocabulary is a bit weak.
            </p>
